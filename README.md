# Barrier Rust
[Barrier](https://github.com/debauchee/barrier) is a fork of synergy.
This is a complete rewrite of Barrier in Rust.

## Goals
- Learn Rust (this is my first real project in Rust)
- Use Barrier with Wayland (Barrier doesn't currently support Wayland)

## Non Goals
- Replace the Barrier C++ codebase
- Support multiple platforms
